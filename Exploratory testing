Let’s try to answer the all-concerned testers question, how to provide the speedy and qualify testing of the almost ready Software product. 
The drawing on my experience, I quite sure that Exploratory testing is a method of manual software testing where test case designing, planning, and executing all happen 
concurrently as the tester uncovers more and more of the app. 
More than just “testing on the fly,” exploratory testing requires a great deal of experience and creativity to be effective. 
You can’t just assign it to interns and hope they know how to cover the app effectively. 
To provide comprehensive app coverage, testers can be strategically split up based on any number of different factors:
- Feature sets
- Actions and large desired outcomes
- Types of user accounts
- Testers’ ability to work like users in certain features or areas
- Feature maturity level. 

In order for each tester to truly cover what part of the software has been assigned to them requires both innovation and experience. 
For example, when testing an app for slot game, a tester needs hard experience with what sort of features might be prone to cause bugs, 
such as complicated mobile gestures, and they also need to stay in the moment and creatively assess new testing opportunities, 
such as using some other currency setting in order to test the appropriate value game outcome. 
How to build up an exploratory testing within a team with 3-4 members. 
Explarotary testing is something that you have to investigate for. So, when a tester takes responsibility to do exploratory testing, 
they act as an almost real science engineer within a short time to make the final decision based on hard knowledge.
The tester's hard knowledge about all aspects of a software product developing is a clue to be succeeded.
