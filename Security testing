1. <Burp Suite> is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications. 
It is designed to be used by hands-on testers to support the testing process.
One of Burp Suite’s main features is its ability to intercept HTTP requests. 
Normally HTTP requests go from your browser straight to a web server and then the web server response is sent back to your browser. 
With Burp Suite, however, HTTP requests go from your browser straight to Burp Suite, which intercepts the traffic.

In Burp Suite you can then tweak the raw HTTP in various ways before forwarding the request on to the web server. 
Essentially this tool is acting as a proxy, a “man in the middle,” between you and the web application, 
allowing you to have finer control over the exact traffic you are sending and receiving.

Our goal with the Burp intercepting proxy feature is to tweak requests so they still follow the rules of HTTP, but can make the application act unexpectedly.
